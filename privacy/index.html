  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy matters to Aayo App, a product of Skybase Innovations Private Limited (the “<em>Company</em>”, “<em>We</em>”, “<em>Aayo</em>”, or “<em>Us</em>”).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, process, use, share and protect information about you. It also tells you how you can access and update your information and make certain choices about how your information is used.</p>
<p>The Privacy Policy covers both “online” (e.g., web and mobile services, including any websites operated by us such as ……………………… or Mobile Application, however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise) and “offline” (e.g., collection of data through mailings, telephone, or in person) activities owned, operated, provided, or made available by Aayo. Our “online” and “offline” activities, in relation to facilitation of transportation services through a network of third party drivers and taxi operators, are collectively referenced as the “Services”.</p>

If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, do not accept the Customer Terms and Conditions or use our Services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the Customer Terms and Conditions.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em>Scope of This Policy</em></strong> This policy applies to all Aayo users, including Riders and Drivers (including Driver applicants), and to all Aayo platforms and services, including our apps, websites, features, and other services (collectively, the “Aayo Platform”). Please remember that your use of the _Aayo Platform_is also subject to our Terms of Service.</li>
<li><strong><em>The Information We Collect</em></strong> When you use Aayo Application, we collect and hold the information you provide for our business purposes and function.<ol>
<li><strong>Personal Information of User</strong> such as name, gender, email address, phone number and information about your device. You may also share additional information with us your profile, like your photo, saved addresses and other preferences.</li>
<li><strong>Information of Partner,</strong> personal information including information about your device, driver’s license, vehicle registration document and insurance information. We may also collect your payment information.</li>
<li><strong>In-apps rating</strong> such as feedbacks, ratings and other information that you provide through phone calls, messages, emails or attachments.</li>
<li><strong>IMEI number</strong> will be tracked to have one user login at a time.</li>
<li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We collect your local information like GPS and WIFI data, depending upon you using the platform as customer or partner:<ol>
<li><strong>Location data of Partner:</strong> We collect precise or approximate location data, including to allow partners, to enable ride tracking to prevent and detect fraud, and to satisfy legal requirements. Aayo collects this data when the Aayo app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile device.</li>
<li><strong>Location data of User:</strong> We collect data from User mobile devices if they enable us to do so. Aayo collects such data from the time you request a ride until it ends and any time the app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) of their mobile device.</li>
<li><strong>Device data:</strong> We may collect data about the devices used to access our services, including the hardware model, IP addresses, serial numbers, manufactures, and device identifiers, push notification tokens. If you are a driver, we may also collect mobile sensor data (speed, direction, acceleration, deceleration, and other technical data)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><em>How We Use Your Information</em></strong><ol>
<li>We use your personal information to:<ol>
<li>Provide it to the platform</li>
<li>Maintain the safety and security of the users</li>
<li>Provide customer support</li>
<li>Improve the platform</li>
<li>Respond to legal obligations</li>
<li>Build and maintain the Aayo community</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>We also use your information to improve the platform and provide you with the efficient and worthwhile experience. For this we use your information to:<ol>
<li>Verify your identity and maintain your account and preferences</li>
<li>Match you with the partners</li>
<li>Connect customers and partners to share their location while on ride</li>
<li>Calculate the prices and process payments</li>
<li>Communicate with you about your experiences</li>
<li>Collect your feedbacks</li>
<li>Promotions and marketing</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong><em>How We Share Your Information</em></strong> We do not sell your personal information. To make the Aayo Platform work, we may need to share your personal information with other users, third parties, and service providers. This section explains when and why we share your information.<ol>
<li><strong><em>Sharing Between Aayo Users</em></strong><ol>
<li><em><strong>Riders and Drivers</strong></em><ol>
<li><em><strong>Rider information shared with Driver:</strong></em> Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the Driver the Rider’s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider’s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Aayo app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider’s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)</li>
<li><em><strong>Driver information shared with Rider:</strong></em> Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver’s Aayo profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver). Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users. If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your consent.</li>
<li><strong><em>Shared Ride Riders:</em></strong> When Riders use a Aayo Shared ride, we share each Rider’s name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.</li>
<li><strong><em>Rides Requested or Paid For by Others:</em></strong> Some rides you take may be requested or paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Aayo Business Profile account, a code or coupon, a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government), or a corporate credit card linked to another account, or another user otherwise requests or pays for a ride for you, we may share some or all of your ride details with that other party,including the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.</li>
<li><strong><em>Referral Programs.</em></strong> If you refer someone to the Aayo Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the Aayo Platform with that user. For example, a referral source may receive a bonus when you join the Aayo Platform or complete a certain number of rides and would receive such information.</li>
