## Making Changes
As the team’s size grows, our company’s operations need to change. We may need to add new guidelines and change existing content so it fits everyone’s needs. You can suggest changes to this handbook by sending a message to the #content public channel in our chat room. Someone from the management team will communicate with you about your suggestions and make the necessary changes. You can also suggest changes to this handbook by sending an email to our info@skybase.com.np.

## Contact
If you submit a question about a trip or through one of our articles, it will go through to our support team, who operate 24/7. They will look into your query and aim to get back to you within 24 hours. This reply will come back to you as an email and also through a push notification through your app. You can reply to this email/notification if you have further questions.
