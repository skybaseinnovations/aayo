    1.  **_Sharing Between Aayo Users_**
        1.  _**Riders and Drivers**_
            1.  _**Rider information shared with Driver:**_ Upon receiving a ride request, we share with the Driver the Rider’s pickup location, name, profile photo, rating, Rider statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Rider), and information the Rider includes in their Rider profile (like preferred pronouns). Upon pickup and during the ride, we share with the Driver the Rider’s destination and any additional stops the Rider inputs into the Aayo app. Once the ride is finished, we also eventually share the Rider’s rating and feedback with the Driver. (We remove the Rider’s identity associated with ratings and feedback when we share it with Drivers, but a Driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or feedback.)
            2.  _**Driver information shared with Rider:**_ Upon a Driver accepting a requested ride, we will share with the Rider the Driver’s name, profile photo, preferred pronouns, rating, real-time location, and the vehicle make, model, color, and license plate, as well as other information in the Driver’s Aayo profile, such as information Drivers choose to add (like country flag and why you drive) and Driver statistics (like approximate number of rides and years as a Driver). Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other contact information with other users. If you report a lost or found item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your consent.
            3.  **_Shared Ride Riders:_** When Riders use a Aayo Shared ride, we share each Rider’s name and profile picture to ensure safety. Riders may also see each other’s pickup and drop-off locations as part of knowing the route while sharing the ride.
            4.  **_Rides Requested or Paid For by Others:_** Some rides you take may be requested or paid for by others. If you take one of those rides using your Aayo Business Profile account, a code or coupon, a subsidized program (e.g., transit or government), or a corporate credit card linked to another account, or another user otherwise requests or pays for a ride for you, we may share some or all of your ride details with that other party,including the date, time, charge, rating given, region of trip, and pick up and drop off location of your ride.
            5.  **_Referral Programs._** If you refer someone to the Aayo Platform, we will let them know that you generated the referral. If another user referred you, we may share information about your use of the Aayo Platform with that user.
